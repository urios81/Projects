### Introducing the dataset
This data set includes statistics of every NBA player from each team from the 1977-2020 (courtesy of
FiveThirtyEight) Additionally, a table of FiveThirtyEight’s glossary will accompany what each category represents. Don’t worry, I did not utilize nor understand every category. You may notice that the five major stats are per 36 minutes instead of per game. One possible reason FiveThirtyEight
measures this is to evaluate the player’s performance on a per-minute basis. Plus, most starters average
roughly 36-37 minutes per game, so rounding it to 36 minutes gives a decent representation of the player’s
production on the court.

#### Determining which Position on Average Scored the Most Points per Decade
The first research question is to find out which position scores the most points on average from the decades 1980-2020. I did this by subsetting the data set where we only consider the five main positions (Point Guard (PG), Shooting Guard(SG), Small Forward(SF), Power Forward (PF), and Center(C)). This is to only consider the players who purely play on one of these positions as some have played multiple positions.

```{r, include=TRUE}
nba_set %>%
  select(year_id, pos, `P/36`) %>%
  subset(pos %in% c("PG", "SG", "SF", "PF", "C")) %>%
  mutate(decade = floor(year_id/10) * 10) %>%
  group_by(decade, pos) %>%
  summarise(avg_pos_pts = mean(`P/36`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(decade, avg_pos_pts)) +
  
  geom_bar(aes(fill = pos), position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Evolution of NBA Scoring By Position By Decade", x = "Decade", y = "Average Points") +
    xlim(1975, 2015) +
    ylim(0,20) +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1")
```

Based on this graph, we can see that there were no instances of drastic change throughout the course of this
time period. The scoring average for all positions were always between the range of about 12.5 to 16 points.
One trend that can be noticed is that shooting guards and small forwards scored less points on average as
each decade passed by, while point guards scored more points. Another trend that is shown is that the power
forward position seemed to be the most consistent throughout the four decades, as the scoring average for
this position was around 14 points for all four decades. Furthermore, the 2010s is the decade in with the
smallest scoring gaps among the five positions, in comparison to the other three decades.
To answer the question, there was not much evolution in regards to the scoring averages of each of the five
positions. Although the scoring average for shooting guards slightly decreased in every decade, this position
held the highest scoring average for every decade (with the exception of the 1990s, where it was edged out
slightly by small forwards). On the other hand, centers usually scored the least amounts of points during
each decade.

#### Evolution of the Three-Point Shot

The second question for this data set is how has the three-point shooting evolved over time. There are two
ways we can go about answering this. One is to group the teams by division (Atlantic, Central, Southeast,
Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest). Then, we can measure the average rate of three-point of attempts for
each division. We can facet the plot to see how the three point usage has evolved for each division.
```{r}
nba_set %>%
mutate(Division = case_when(franch_id %in% c("MIL", "IND", "CHI", "CLE", "DET") ~ "CENTRAL",
franch_id %in% c("MIA", "ORL", "CHA", "WAS", "ATL") ~ "SOUTHEAST",
franch_id %in% c("DEN", "OKC", "UTA", "POR", "MIN") ~ "NORTHWEST",
franch_id %in% c("LAL", "LAC", "GSW", "SAC", "PHO") ~ "PACIFIC",
franch_id %in% c("HOU", "DAL", "SAS", "MEM", "NOH") ~ "SOUTHWEST",
franch_id %in% c("NYK", "TOR", "BOS", "NJN", "PHI") ~ "ATLANTIC")) %>%
group_by(Division, year_id) %>%
summarize(avg_3Usage = mean(`3PAr`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
ggplot() +
geom_line(aes(x = year_id, y = avg_3Usage, color = Division)) +
labs(title = "Average Three-Point Usage by NBA Division",
x = "Year",
y = "Three-Point Usage (Percentage)") +
facet_wrap(~ Division) +
theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The graph above depicts the average three point usage for each of the six NBA divisions from 1977-2020.
It is clear that for all divisions, there is a steep increase in three-point attempts since the introduction of
the three-point line in 1979. We see a sizable increased rate in three-point attempts from 20% to up to
40% at around early to mid-2010’s. This makes sense as the floor is more spaced and we have players like
Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and James Harden, who have been some of the contributors of utilizing the
three-point shot more often.
One thing to point out is that all divisions experienced dips in three point usage in the late 1990s to early
2000s. This is probably due to the more stifling defenses along the perimeter, which will discourage teams
from attempting three-pointers. Additionally, centers and forwards were the focal point of offenses, whereas
guards run the offense and feeding the ball to their centers and forwards. Since then, all divisions experienced
increases in three-point usage, but the Central, Northwest, and Southeast divisions experienced much steeper
increases in the mid 2010s, which was when three-point shooting really became mainstream.
The second method is to create a heat map that shows the three-point usage for every franchise. Note that
some franchises were founded later than others, which is why there are gaps within the heat map.

```{r, include=TRUE}
grouped <- nba_set %>%
filter(!is.na(`3PAr`))
summarise(group_by(grouped, franch_id, year_id), Percent3Attempts = mean(`3PAr`)) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year_id, y = franch_id, fill = Percent3Attempts)) +
geom_tile() +
labs(x = "Year",
y = "Franchise",
fill = "% of Attempts Were 3 Pointers")
```

Figure Interpretation: From this figure, we can see that 3 point field goal attempts have increased drastically
since the NBA was first founded. Notable franchises that rely heavily on these attempts today include
HOU, MIN, and TOR.

#### So, how has 3 point usage evolved over time? 
In the beginning, the 3 point shot was virtually
nonexistent with a field goal attempt percentage in the low single digits. Over time however, teams and
coaches began to realize the efficiency of the shot and, as visualized in both graphs, 3 point shots increased
significantly as a result across the board. Today, 3 point shots are a major part of basketball with some
teams having nearly as much as 50% of their shots being 3 point attempts.
